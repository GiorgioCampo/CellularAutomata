In this repository various rules of 1D CAs are explored, with different set of neighborhoods. The main goal is to find parameters that can predict whether a rule will exhibit the same complex behaviour of Wolfram's Rule 110, and extract a classification based on such parameters, coherent with Wolfram's classification scheme.
